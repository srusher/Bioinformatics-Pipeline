# Bioinformatics-Pipeline

## Overview
This project provides a pipeline bash script used for the retrieval, assembly (alignment and scaffold assembly), gene annotation, and RNA seq analysis of B. Thuringiensis sequence reads.

## Installation
- I still need to add the installation bash script to this repository

## Notes
- This script assumes you will be working in the ~/BIFS619/Bthuringiensis/ directory - I will need to make future adjustments to make it executable on all Linux workstations
