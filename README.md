# Bioinformatics-Pipeline

## Overview
My first bioinformatics workflow. This pipeline performs the retrieval, assembly, gene annotation, and RNA seq analysis of B. Thuringiensis paired, short-reads.

## Notes
- This is not intended to be a reproducible workflow, just a demo of a simple bioinformatics workflow
